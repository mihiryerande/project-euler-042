# Problem 42:
#     Coded Triangle Numbers
#
# Description:
#     The n'th term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by, t_n = Â½n(n+1);
#       so the first ten triangle numbers are:
#         1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...
#
#     By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its alphabetical position
#       and adding these values we form a word value.
#     For example, the word value for SKY is 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = t10.
#     If the word value is a triangle number then we shall call the word a triangle word.
#
#     Using words.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'),
#       a 16K text file containing nearly two-thousand common English words,
#       how many are triangle words?
